# Assignment 9 - Tuples & Named Tuples

Named tuples are basically easy-to-create, lightweight object types. Named tuple instances can be referenced using 
standard tuple syntax. They can be used similarly to struct or other common record types, except that they are immutable.

In this assignment, To understand significance of NamedTuple and it's usage. As part of this assignment we have to write 3 functions
1. Using namedtuple, calculate the largest blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age, and average age 
2. The above step is repeated using a dictionary and it has to be proved that named tuple method is faster than dict method
3. Create fake data (you can use Faker for company names) for imaginary stock exchange for top 100 companies (name, symbol, open, high, close). Assign a random weight to all the companies. Calculate and show what value the stock market started at, what was the highest value during the day, and where did it end. Make sure your open, high, close are not totally random



## Function 1 - randomprofiles_namedtuple: 

1. Using Faker to create profiles of 10000 people with following information and each of the reocords stored as Named Tuple within a list.
2. Once 10000 named tuples are loaded in a list, calculate blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age, and average age and store it in a new named tuple	
3. print the values in new named tuple

## Function 2 - randomprofiles_dict: 

1. Using Faker to create profiles of 10000 people with following information and each of the reocords stored as Dictionary within a list.
2. Once 10000 dictionary are loaded in a list, calculate blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age, and average age and store it in a ne Dictionary	
3. print the values in new Dictionary

## top100companydata function using namedtuple :

1. This function is used to generate stock market data of 100 companies for a particular day using a namedtuple

a. compname - From faker
b. market cap - round(random.uniform(1,100),2)
c. date - today's date
d. scrip - first 3 characters from compname
e. open - any value between 100 and 3000 --round(random.uniform(100,3000),2)
f. high - any value higher than open price be 1 to 5 % (open + (open * random.randint(1,5))/100)
g. close - any value lower than high price  (high - (high * random.randint(-5,1))/100)


## top100companystock function :

1. get the stock market data of 100 companies by calling chem100niftydaydata.
2. calculate weightage for individual companies using marketcap/totalmarketcap
3. using following formula to calculate index open high and close.
	top100companystock.open = round(sum([x.open*(x.marketcap/totalmarketvalue) for x in chem100list]),2)
	top100companystock.high = round(sum([x.high*(x.marketcap/totalmarketvalue) for x in chem100list]),2)
	top100companystock.close = round(sum([x.close*(x.marketcap/totalmarketvalue) for x in chem100list]),2)
